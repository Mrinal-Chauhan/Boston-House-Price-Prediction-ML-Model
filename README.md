# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a regression model built to predict house prices based on various features such as crime rate, property tax, accessibility to highways, and others. The model uses a dataset of 506 samples with 13 input features to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- **CRIM**: Crime rate by town
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX**: Nitric oxide concentration
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to employment centers
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX**: Property tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B**: Proportion of Black residents
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of lower status of the population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Preprocessing
We cleaned and preprocessed the data by:
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Identifying and treating outliers
- Creating new features to handle multicollinearity between highly correlated variables such as `RAD` and `TAX`

### 2. Feature Scaling
To ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, we scaled the data using normalization/standardization techniques. This step improves model convergence and accuracy by preventing features with larger values from dominating the model.

### 3. Model Building
We built a regression model using various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso) to predict house prices based on the input features.

### 4. Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

These metrics helped us measure how accurately the model predicted house prices and identify areas for improvement.
